    Debugger commands:
      apropos           -- List debugger commands related to a word or subject.
      breakpoint        -- Commands for operating on breakpoints (see &apos;help b&apos; for shorthand.)
      command           -- Commands for managing custom LLDB commands.
      disassemble       -- Disassemble specified instructions in the current target.  Defaults to the current function for the current thread and stack frame.
      expression        -- Evaluate an expression on the current thread.  Displays any returned value with LLDB&apos;s default formatting.
      frame             -- Commands for selecting and examing the current thread&apos;s stack frames.
      gdb-remote        -- Connect to a process via remote GDB server.  If no host is specifed, localhost is assumed.
      gui               -- Switch into the curses based GUI mode.
      help              -- Show a list of all debugger commands, or give details about a specific command.
      kdp-remote        -- Connect to a process via remote KDP server.  If no UDP port is specified, port 41139 is assumed.
      language          -- Commands specific to a source language.
      log               -- Commands controlling LLDB internal logging.
      memory            -- Commands for operating on memory in the current target process.
      platform          -- Commands to manage and create platforms.
      plugin            -- Commands for managing LLDB plugins.
      process           -- Commands for interacting with processes on the current platform.
      quit              -- Quit the LLDB debugger.
      register          -- Commands to access registers for the current thread and stack frame.
      reproducer        -- Commands for manipulating reproducers. Reproducers make it possible to capture full debug sessions with all its dependencies. The
                           resulting reproducer is used to replay the debug session while debugging the debugger.
                           Because reproducers need the whole the debug session from beginning to end, you need to launch the debugger in capture or replay mode,
                           commonly though the command line driver.
                           Reproducers are unrelated record-replay debugging, as you cannot interact with the debugger during replay.
      script            -- Invoke the script interpreter with provided code and display any results.  Start the interactive interpreter if no code is supplied.
      session           -- Commands controlling LLDB session.
      settings          -- Commands for managing LLDB settings.
      source            -- Commands for examining source code described by debug information for the current target process.
      statistics        -- Print statistics about a debugging session
      target            -- Commands for operating on debugger targets.
      thread            -- Commands for operating on one or more threads in the current process.
      trace             -- Commands for loading and using processor trace information.
      type              -- Commands for operating on the type system.
      version           -- Show the LLDB debugger version.
      watchpoint        -- Commands for operating on watchpoints.
    Current command abbreviations (type &apos;help command alias&apos; for more info):
      add-dsym  -- Add a debug symbol file to one of the target&apos;s current modules by specifying a path to a debug symbols file or by using the options to specify
                   a module.
      attach    -- Attach to process by ID or name.
      b         -- Set a breakpoint using one of several shorthand formats.
